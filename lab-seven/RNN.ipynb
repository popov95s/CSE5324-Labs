    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we will be using is a collection of amazon reviews for instant video products found at http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/. Our set includes the reviews’ product, reviewer, text review, rating, helpfulness/unhelpfulness, and other metadata. The specific dataset we are using is a “5-core” dataset meaning that it includes only products and reviewers that have more than 5 reviews on amazon. This means that each product in this dataset has at least 5 reviews and that each reviewer in this dataset has posted at least 5 reviews for this category. The set includes over 37,000 reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This data was originally collected by Amazon as consumers browsed, bought, and reviewed products. This data is necessary for amazon to be able to display the reviews on each product. The specific dataset we are using is UCSD’s collection that has been structured by two researchers (Julian McAuley, Alex Yang) to understand why and what reviews are helpful to consumers when it comes to purchasing an object. They outline their findings with this data in the following paper: http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/pdfs/www16b.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prediction Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Reviews have become increasingly crucial in consumer purchase decisions. As discussed in a BrightLocal study, 88% of consumers incorporate reviews into their purchase decisions. This finding for most consumers is obvious. A less obvious finding is that although customers are relying more on review data, they are reading less of them. It was found that by reading up to six reviews 73% of consumers formed an opinion as opposed to 64% in 2014. Moreover, it was found that by reading just one to three reviews 40% of consumers formed an opinion as opposed to 29% in 2014. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consumers are basing decisions on less reviews. This trend introduces unique issues, for example, what if the first few reviews a consumer reads are not very helpful? What if all of the reviews on a product are unhelpful? This puts a premium on presenting and identifying useful reviews. If a company could know beforehand which types of reviews are helpful, they could enforce those attributes as rules or they could promote those reviews before other unhelpful reviews. \n",
    "Given this scenario, our prediction task for this data is the to determine the helpfulness of a review. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Third Parties\n",
    "\n",
    "The parties interested in this result would include e-commerce vendors (Amazon, eBay, Alibaba, etc..) that offer reviews on products. This could give them insight on what reviews are generally helpful and how they can get these reviews in front of consumers before other reviews to help with product conversion. This would also allow them to enforce potential rules on reviews to remove unhelpful reviews that would not be helpful and potentially detrimental to product conversion. It would also help with products that do not yet have many reviews where the normal process of voting has not taken place yet. \n",
    "\n",
    "More third parties that would be interested in the data(although not specifically these findings) include advertisers, that would benefit from a text analysis of the reviews to see what relating products or needs are mentioned. They could use this information to know when to advertise certain products. Consumers will benefit from having more helpful reviews. \n",
